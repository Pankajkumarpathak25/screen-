Using screen to attach and detach console sessions
If you run a program in SSH, and then close out ssh you can not get back into the console.

However you can use screen to attach + detach a console.

If you have centos, run 
yum -y install screen

If you have debian/ubuntu run
apt-get install screen

Once installed, screen is simple to use. Type

screen

run the command you want to run, for example

./run_server.sh

to detach run: ctrl + a + d

Once detached you can check current screens with

screen -ls

Use screen -r to attach a single screen.

On multiple screens you may see something like:

screen -ls
There are screens on:
119217.pts-3.webhosting1200 (Detached)
344074.pts-13.webhosting1200 (Detached)
825035.pts-1.webhosting1200 (Detached)
650824.downlbk (Detached)
4 Sockets in /var/run/screen/S-root.

In this case attach with the value before pts, for example

screen -r 344074

You can shorthand with screen -r 3 (assuming only one begins with the number 3).
